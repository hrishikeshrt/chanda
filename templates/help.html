            <p class="card-text">
                <b>Sanskrit prosody</b> or <b>chandaśāstra</b> is the study of poetic metres and verse in Sanskrit.
                <b>Chanda</b>s (Sanskrit metres) include those based on a fixed number of <b>akṣara</b> (syllables) per
                verse, and those based on fixed number of <b>mātra</b> (morae) per verse.
            </p>

    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Where is the <b>chandaśāstra</b> used?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Each <b>chanda</b> has its own rhythm, movements and aesthetics, making the Sanskrit poetic works
                easier to memorise and recite. Most of the ancient Sanskrit literature adheres to <b>chandaśāstra</b>.
                <br>

                The system can also be used for error identification and correction of text present in the existing
                digital corpora, text generated by OCR systems, text generated by text-to-speech systems, etc.

            <h5 class="card-title">How to use the <b>chanda</b> identification system?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                The identification system can identify <b>chanda</b> from <b>saṃskṛta</b> text in <i>Devanagari</i>.
                <b>Chanda</b> can be identified in two modes.

                <ol>
                    <li>Treat all the lines independently. (<code>Line Mode</code>)</li>
                    <li>Treat the lines as a set of verses. (<code>Verse Mode</code>)</li>
                </ol>

                The system in addition to identifying the <b>chanda</b> from the provided verses, is also capable of
                suggestiong most-likely matches (<i>fuzzy matches</i>), in case a direct match could not be found.
            </p>

    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">How is a <b>chanda</b> identified?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Every <b>akṣara</b> (syllable) is identified to be either <b>laghu</b> (short) or <b>guru</b> (long) as
                per the
                following rules of <b>chandaśāstra</b>.
                <ol>
                    <li><b>laghu</b> vowels: अ, इ, उ, ऋ, ऌ</li>
                    <li><b>guru</b> vowels: आ, ई, ऊ, ॠ, ॡ, ए, ऐ, ओ, औ</li>
                    <li><b>akṣara</b> is marked <b>laghu</b> or <b>guru</b> based on the vowel it contains.</li>
                    <li><b>akṣara</b> containing <b>anusvāra</b> or <b>visarga</b> is always marked as <b>guru</b>.</li>
                    <li><b>akṣara</b> that is followed by a <b>saṃyuktākṣara</b> (conjunct letter) is always marked
                        <b>guru</b>.</li>
                    <li><b>akṣara</b> that appears at the end of the <b>pada</b> (line) is always marked as <b>guru</b>.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                Thus, every line of Sanskrit text can be transformed into a binary sequence of <b>laghu</b> and
                <b>guru</b> markers. Specific patterns of such sequences are identified as various <b>chanda</b>s.
                <br>

                In the case of <b>akṣaragaṇavṛtta</b>, (i.e. meters requiring specific sequence of letters), the
                <b>akṣara</b>s are
                divided into groups of 3.
                There are 8 (2<sup>3</sup>) possible sequences of <b>laghu</b>-<b>guru</b> markers, each of which has
                been given a special name, called <b>gaṇa</b>.
                <br>

                The following table describes the <b>gaṇa</b>s,
                <br>

            <h5 class="card-title">What are the fuzzy matches?</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                There may be cases where a <b>chanda</b> match is not found for a particular line.
                This can happen due to two reasons.
                <ol>
                    <li>The <b>chanda</b> definition is missing from the database.</li>
                    <li>There is an error in the line.</li>
                </ol>

                We are working towards expanding our <b>chanda</b> database to cover more and more <b>chanda</b>s.
                Fuzzy matches may help in the event of the input line containing an error.
                <br>

                Fuzzy matches are the most probable matches for the given line. The suggestions shown contain the
                syllables from the original string, alongwith the suggested places where change might be required. The
                suggestions are identified by three letters <code>i</code>, <code>d</code> and <code>r</code>,
                indicating insert, delete and replace operations.
                <br>

                They are used in the following manner,
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <code>i(laghu-guru-marker)</code>: This type of the notation indicates the insertion of a
                        <b>new</b> syllable. <code>i(ल)</code> indicates that a <b>laghu</b> syllable needs to be inserted,
                        similarly <code>i(ग)</code> indicates that a <b>guru</b> syllable needs to
                        be inserted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>r(syllable)[laghu-guru-marker]{suggestion}</code>: This type of notation indicates that the
                        <code>syllable</code> needs to be replaced by a <b>laghu</b> or <b>guru</b> syllable (depending upon
                        the marker).
                        In some cases, a suggested change would be included.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>d(syllable)</code>: This type of notation indicates that the <code>syllable</code> needs to be
                        deleted.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                The recommended changes for each <b>chanda</b> suggestion corresponds to the changes needed to transform the
                line into one that conforms to that specific <b>chanda</b>.

            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Transliteration support is powered by the fantastic <a href="https://pypi.org/project/indic-transliteration/"><code>indic-transliteration</code></a> library.
                <br>
                Therefore, any scheme supported by this library can be used to provide input. Further, this also applies for all input types.
                i.e., Images or files uploaded can also contain text in any supported transliteration scheme. This includes
                all promient schemes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari_transliteration">Devanagari transliteration</a>.
                It also includes all prominent Indian language scripts, such as, Bangla, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Gujarati and many more.
                <br>
                As a result, if the language of choice shares follows Sanskrit <b>Chandaśāstra</b> one can even provide input in the script
                of that language (e.g., Telugu) and the system will work seemlessly.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                The output, by default, will be displayed using the scheme that input follows. However, this
                can be controlled and the output can be displayed using multiple transliteration schemes.
