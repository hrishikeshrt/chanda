        <b>Sanskrit prosody</b> or <b>chandaśāstra</b> (<i>Devanagari: छन्दशास्त्र</i>) is the study of poetic metres and verse in Sanskrit.
        The <b>chanda</b>s have their own rhythm, movements and aesthetics. Sanskrit metres include those
        based on a fixed number of syllables per verse, and those based on fixed number of morae per
        verse.

        Every <b>akṣara</b> (syllable) is identified to be either <b>laghu</b> (short) or <b>guru</b> (long) as per the
        rules of <b>chandaśāstra</b>. Thus, every line of Sanskrit text can be transformed into a binary sequence of
        <b>laghu</b> and <b>guru</b> markers. Specific patterns of such sequences are identified as various chandas.
